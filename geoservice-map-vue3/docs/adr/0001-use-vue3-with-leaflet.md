# Title: Use Vue 3 with Leaflet

## Context
In the development of our project, we needed a robust framework for building user interfaces and a powerful library for handling maps. After evaluating various options, we focused on Vue 3 for its reactivity and component-based architecture, and Leaflet for its simplicity and performance in rendering maps.

## Decision
We have decided to use Vue 3 in conjunction with Leaflet for our project. This combination allows us to create a dynamic and interactive user interface while efficiently managing map functionalities.

## Consequences
Using Vue 3 will enable us to leverage its modern features such as Composition API, which enhances code organization and reusability. Leaflet will provide us with a lightweight solution for map rendering, ensuring fast load times and a smooth user experience. However, we will need to ensure that our team is familiar with both technologies to maximize their potential.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **React with Leaflet**: While React is a popular choice, we opted for Vue 3 due to its simpler learning curve and better integration with our existing codebase.
2. **Angular with Google Maps**: This option was considered but dismissed due to the complexity of Angular and the licensing issues associated with Google Maps.

## Expected Impact
The choice of Vue 3 with Leaflet is expected to enhance our development speed and maintainability, ultimately leading to a more efficient workflow and a better product for our users.
