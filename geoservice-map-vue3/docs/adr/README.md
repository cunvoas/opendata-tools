# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the project. ADRs are a way to capture architectural decisions made while developing the project, providing a historical record of the rationale behind these decisions.

Each ADR is stored in its own markdown file, following a numbered format. The filename indicates the decision number and a brief description of the decision. The content of each ADR includes the context of the decision, the decision made, the consequences of that decision, and any alternatives that were considered.

The goal of maintaining ADRs is to ensure that all team members are aware of the architectural choices made and the reasons behind them, facilitating better communication and understanding throughout the project lifecycle.
